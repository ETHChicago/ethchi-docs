[lowe's Project Unlock](https://www.lowesinnovationlabs.com/projects/projectunlock)

### Arbitrum

- Improve Arbitrum governance - changes to voting, or better forums to be less spammy, or improvements to security council.
- Voting on L1 using L2 snapshot - On L1, one can access the latest confirmed L2 state / block hash from the rollup contract. With that, a smart contract should be able to prove on L1 the L2 snapshot voting power of a delegate. 

Orbit Related
- General message router for 3 layers - easily send messages from L1->L3, L3->L3, L1->L2 etc
- Short lived / fixed lifetime chains - spin up an Orbit chain with a specific lifetime.
- Orbit external DA integration - Use other chains like Celestia as DA provider for an Orbit chain.
- Any kind of Orbit wallet improvments - how can we auto connect to orbit chains or orbit visualizations.
- Building a Orbit chain with AML/KYC built into at the chain level - Create a way to permission orbit chains so only certain addresses can transact and participate as validators
- Building an ecosystem of Orbit chains that are interoperable - Create multiple Orbit chains that have the ability to transact with one another 
- Add in On-chain governance to Orbit Chains - Design system to help project implement governance protocols on Orbit Chains 
  


Stylus Related
- Migrating a solidity contract to a different language using stylus and utilizing it in unique ways 
- Use Stylus to enable something currently not available in solidity, use a library in a different language to enable something in stylus
